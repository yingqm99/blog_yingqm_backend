# Things to be cautious in this project

## CORS
This project splits the front-end and back-end, which includes some issues that I did not expect before. For CORS, in front-end, we should enable the cookies, which should be like:
```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:8080/login", {
      method: 'POST',
      credentials: 'include',
      headers: {
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin':'http://localhost:8080',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': true,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        'name': formData.name.value,
        'password': formData.password.value,
      })
    })
```
Notice that here the credentials should be set be 'include', which means that it enables the cookies among different origins. Also, when we set the credentials to "include", the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' should be set to a specific domain with the port number, otherwise the browser will throw an error.
In Java backend, we need to enable CORS to, therefore, we have to add the annotation:
```java
@CrossOrigin(origins="http://localhost:3000", allowCredentials = "true")
```
before every controller.

## Controller Return Type
For SpringBoot, the return type of the controller should not be JSON format, return the value as the POJO or Map<>, SpringBoot will handle the convert for use.
